Kafka Admin
============

## Dependencies
- [InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/) 
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)

These can simply run by docker with this `docker-compose.yml`:
```
version: '2'
services:
  influxdb:
    image: influxdb
    ports:
      - 8086:8086
  zk:
    image: zookeeper
    ports:
      - 2181:2181
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 9092:9092
      - 9999:9999
    links:
      - zk
    environment:
      JMX_PORT: 9999
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zk:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
```
Please note that `JMX_PORT` should be assigned for kafka instance.

See `docker-compose.yml` get more info
