## Server Metrics
### Here are the important metrics to alert on a Kafka broker:

- `kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=UnderReplicatedPartitions`
Number of under-replicated partitions (| ISR | < | all replicas |). Alert if value is greater than 0.

- `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=OfflinePartitionsCount`
Number of partitions that donâ€™t have an active leader and are hence not writable or readable. Alert if value is greater than 0.

- `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=ActiveControllerCount`
Number of active controllers in the cluster. Alert if value is anything other than 1.

### Here are the list of metrics to observe on a Kafka broker:

- `kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=MessagesInPerSec`
Aggregate incoming message rate.

- `kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=BytesInPerSec`
Aggregate incoming byte rate.

- `kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=BytesOutPerSec`
Aggregate outgoing byte rate.

- `kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestsPerSec,request={Produce|FetchConsumer|FetchFollower}`
Request rate.

- `kafka.log:type=LogFlushStats,name=LogFlushRateAndTimeMs`
Log flush rate and time.

- `kafka.controller:type=ControllerStats,name=LeaderElectionRateAndTimeMs`
Leader election rate and latency.

- `kafka.controller:type=ControllerStats,name=UncleanLeaderElectionsPerSec`
Unclean leader election rate.

- `kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=PartitionCount`
Number of partitions on this broker. This should be mostly even across all brokers.

- `kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=LeaderCount`
Number of leaders on this broker. This should be mostly even across all brokers. If not, set auto.leader.rebalance.enable to true on all brokers in the cluster.

- `kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=IsrShrinksPerSec`
If a broker goes down, ISR for some of the partitions will shrink. When that broker is up again, ISR will be expanded once the replicas are fully caught up. Other than that, the expected value for both ISR shrink rate and expansion rate is 0.

- `kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=IsrExpandsPerSec`
When a broker is brought up after a failure, it starts catching up by reading from the leader. Once it is caught up, it gets added back to the ISR.

- `kafka.server:type=ReplicaFetcherManager,name=MaxLag,clientId=Replica`
Maximum lag in messages between the follower and leader replicas. This is controlled by the replica.lag.max.messages config.

- `kafka.server:type=FetcherLagMetrics,name=ConsumerLag,clientId=([-.\w]+),topic=([-.\w]+),partition=([0-9]+)`
Lag in number of messages per follower replica. This is useful to know if the replica is slow or has stopped replicating from the leader.

- `kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=TotalTimeMs,request={Produce|FetchConsumer|FetchFollower}`
Total time in ms to serve the specified request.

- `kafka.server:type=DelayedOperationPurgatory,delayedOperation=Produce,name=PurgatorySize`
Number of requests waiting in the producer purgatory. This should be non-zero acks=-1 is used on the producer.

- `kafka.server:type=DelayedOperationPurgatory,delayedOperation=Fetch,name=PurgatorySize`
Number of requests waiting in the fetch purgatory. This is high if consumers use a large value for fetch.wait.max.ms .

## ZooKeeper Metrics
We expose counts for ZooKeeper state transitions, which can help to spot problems, e.g., with broker sessions to ZooKeeper. The metrics currently show the rate of transitions per second for each one of the possible states. 

Here is the list of the counters we expose, one for each possible ZooKeeper client states:

- `kafka.server:type=SessionExpireListener,name=ZooKeeperDisconnectedPerSec`
Zookeeper client is currently disconnected from the ensemble. The client lost its previous connection to a server and it is currently trying to reconnect. The session is not necessarily expired.

- `kafka.server:type=SessionExpireListener,name=ZooKeeperSyncConnectedPerSec`
ZooKeeper client is connected to the ensemble and ready to execute operations.

- `kafka.server:type=SessionExpireListener,name=ZooKeeperAuthFailedPerSec`
An attempt to connect to the ensemble failed because the client has not provided correct credentials.

- `kafka.server:type=SessionExpireListener,name=ZooKeeperConnectedReadOnlyPerSec`
The server the client is connected to is currently LOOKING, which means that it is neither FOLLOWING nor LEADING. Consequently, the client can only read the ZooKeeper state, but not make any changes (create, delete, or set the data of znodes).

- `kafka.server:type=SessionExpireListener,name=ZooKeeperSaslAuthenticatedPerSec`
Client has successfully authenticated.

- `kafka.server:type=SessionExpireListener,name=ZooKeeperExpiredPerSec`
The ZooKeeper session has expired. When a session expires, we can have leader changes and even a new controller. It is important to keep an eye on the number of such events across a Kafka cluster and if the overall number is high, then we have a few recommendations:
  - Check the health of your network
  - Check for garbage collection issues and tune it accordingly
  - If necessary, increase the session time out by setting the value of `zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms`.

### Fetch Metrics
MBean: `kafka.consumer:type=consumer-fetch-manager-metrics,client-id=([-.w]+)`

- `records-lag-max`
The maximum lag in terms of number of records for any partition in this window. An increasing value over time is your best indication that the consumer group is not keeping up with the producers.

- `fetch-latency-max`
The max time taken for a fetch request.

- `commit-latency-max`
The max time taken for a commit request.

- `commit-rate`
The number of commit calls per second.

- `join-rate`
The number of group joins per second. Group joining is the first phase of the rebalance protocol. A large value indicates that the consumer group is unstable and will likely be coupled with increased lag.

- `join-time-avg`
The average time taken for a group rejoin. This value can get as high as the configured session timeout for the consumer, but should usually be lower.

- `join-time-max`
The max time taken for a group rejoin. This value should not get much higher than the configured session timeout for the consumer.

The number of group syncs per second. Group synchronization is the second and last phase of the rebalance protocol. Similar to join-rate, a large value indicates group instability.

- `sync-time-avg`
The average time taken for a group sync.

- `sync-time-max`
The max time taken for a group sync.

- `heartbeat-rate`
The average number of heartbeats per second. After a rebalance, the consumer sends heartbeats to the coordinator to keep itself active in the group. You can control this using the heartbeat.interval.ms setting for the consumer. You may see a lower rate than configured if the processing loop is taking more time to handle message batches. Usually this is OK as long as you see no increase in the join rate.

- `heartbeat-response-time-max`
The max time taken to receive a response to a heartbeat request.

- `last-heartbeat-seconds-ago`
The number of seconds since the last controller heartbeat.

### Global Request Metrics

The rate at which this consumer commits offsets to Kafka. This is only relevant if offsets.storage=kafka.

- `kafka.consumer:type=ZookeeperConsumerConnector,name=ZooKeeperCommitsPerSec,clientId=([-.\w]+)`
The rate at which this consumer commits offsets to ZooKeeper. This is only relevant if offsets.storage=zookeeper. Monitor this value if your ZooKeeper cluster is under performing due to high write load.
